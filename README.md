"This is a line from RStudio"
"There are question marks under Status in the Git tab"
"I don't get the same create mode messages like Jenny's example"

"Here's what happened after I commited line 4:
fatal: Unable to create '/Users/cgtaylor/ownCloud/asda/git/jbtutorial/.git/index.lock': File exists.

If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.

But when I looked for the index.lock file it wasn't there"

"pulled and pushed and then tried commit again and it worked"

"Could finally commit line 15 successfully without the usual index.lock 
error.  The git process seems to keep crashing and messing this up"

"The same error keeps coming up.  I seem to be doing it in the wrong order"

"My guess it has something to do with the info message that the branch is 
ahead of origin/master by 1 commit.  Not sure how this happened and not sure how this can be fixed?"

"An extra push is always required in order for the commit to work"

"And the push must come after a failed commit.  Doesn't matter how many times the push is done before the commit"

"I pushed twice after the successful commit.  Maybe it's in sync now?"

"Nope, still not.  The order of save, check staged, commit isn't working properly"

"This time the commit worked after the second try.  I think it has something
to do with using ownCloud and the lag in its syncing"

"Yup, the commit doesn't work on the first try because of the ownCloud sync"

"I want to move this out of the ownCloud directory"

"Now that this project was moved out of the ownCloud directory, the commit will hopefully only take one attempt"

"Yup, only one commit was needed now so that confirms that the issue was with ownCloud"

"Testing on campus"
